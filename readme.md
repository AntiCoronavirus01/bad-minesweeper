# Minesweeper Game

This is a Minesweeper game built using Unity. The goal of the game is to uncover all the cells on the grid without hitting any mines.
Gameplay

The game starts with a grid of cells, some of which contain hidden mines. The player can click on a cell to uncover it. If the cell contains a mine, the game is over. If the cell is empty, it will display the number of adjacent cells that contain mines. The player can then use this information to strategically uncover the remaining cells. The game is won when all non-mine cells are uncovered.

Known Issues

While the game is fully functional, there are a few known issues that need to be addressed:

* UI responsiveness: The user interface can be unresponsive at times, especially when rapidly clicking on cells or adjusting settings. This issue may be more noticeable on lower-end hardware.
* Lack of game save feature: The game currently lacks a save feature, so if the player exits the game in the middle of a session, progress will not be saved.
